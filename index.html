		<h1>HW3 Sample Pages for Testing</h1>
		<p>There are multiple sample pages here to use as you build your web crawler code and
		   the associated test cases.  Unlike the general web, these pages are guaranteed to not
		   change during the assignment.  They also have small input sets, so you can easily predict the output by viewing the page source in your browser.</p>
		   
		<ul>
			<li><a href="page0.html">page0.html</a> - A page with no links and no images.</li>
			<li><a href="page1.html">page1.html</a> - A page with links and images, including self links and broken links.</li>
			<li><a href="page2.html">page2.html</a> - A page with some links and images</li>
			<li><a href="page3.html">page3.html</a> - A page with images but no links.</li>
			<li>This page is an example of links and no images.</li>
